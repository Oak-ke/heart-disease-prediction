Heart Disease Prediction Project
Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on a set of clinical data. The goal is to provide a predictive tool that can assist in early risk assessment. The project follows a standard data science workflow, from data preprocessing and exploratory analysis to model training and evaluation.

Problem Statement
Heart disease is a major global health concern. The ability to accurately predict its presence from a patient's medical history and test results can be a valuable tool for healthcare professionals. This project develops a machine learning model to classify patients into having or not having heart disease, helping to identify at-risk individuals.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from a public repository, such as Kaggle or the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 1025 records and 14 columns, with no missing values. The columns include various medical attributes, such as:

age: Age in years

sex: Sex (1 = male, 0 = female)

cp: Chest pain type (0-3)

chol: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl

thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved

exang: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)

target: The final output variable (0 = no heart disease, 1 = heart disease)

Methodology
The project follows these key steps:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: The raw data is loaded using Pandas. Since the dataset has no missing values, the main focus of this stage is on one-hot encoding the categorical features (sex, cp, fbs, etc.) to prepare the data for the machine learning model.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Matplotlib and Seaborn are used to visualize the data. This helps in understanding the distribution of features and their relationships with the target variable.

Model Training and Evaluation: The dataset is split into training and testing sets. A classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression or a Decision Tree) is trained on the data. The model's performance is then evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

Model Deployment (Optional): A basic web application can be built with Flask or Streamlit to create an interactive interface for the model.

Technology Stack
Python: The core programming language.

Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.

NumPy: For numerical operations.

Scikit-learn: For machine learning model building and evaluation.

Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.

Flask/Streamlit (Optional): For deploying the model as a web application.
